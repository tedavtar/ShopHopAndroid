Android App for shopper to build a shopping list and sync it with their Qualcom Toq watch

This was a group project--me and 3 others--for my User Interfaces class (CS160).

This Android application allows shoppers to build a shopping list on their phone from a database of known items, select a store, and save lists to Parse.  Then they may sync their list with their Qualcomm Toq watch.
I worked on all the code for building, storing, retrieving lists, coding animations for our mock ups, and some UI design.

The other group members worked on creating demo videos, powerpoint presentations, code for displaying the list onto, creating the Image assets, and conducting user interviews.
However, when making the mock up animations (using Framer JS), I did make a few edits on Illustrator to achieve pixel perfection.

Credit for code I wrote:
Honestly, I did not do much code-wise except scavenge for the resources and follow tutorials--of course, this was an involved process.
I learned about MVC, singletons, and how to program for Android from Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.
And I learned how to use the Parse API from the tutorial on CodeAcademy.
